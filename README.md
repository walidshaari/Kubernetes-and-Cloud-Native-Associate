  *Linux Foundation offer several discounts around the year, try to check first if there is a discount. e.g. CyberMonday, Kubecon attendees among other special holidays/events*
  
## Quick preps:
- First, a history and background
  - Cloud Native Computing Foundation context from a CNCF legend Dan Kohn, in less than 10 minutes [Keynote: Stitching Things Together â€“ Dan Kohn, Executive Director, Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://youtu.be/lmGFgZ889kY)

### Repo Strategy (My opinion on what is important)
This is a good start into Cloud Native and Kubernetes journey; it won't guarantee you a [job or salary increase](https://kube.careers/report-2021-q4#:~:text=for%20Kubernetes%20jobs%3F-,Not%20much%2C%20it%20seems.,-Of%20all%20the). Your goal should be to learn more about cloud-native computing foundation CNCF, and Kubernetes eco-systems and how that might help you in your career or hobbies.
- Join a CNCF community, local or virtual, be part of the CNCF community
- Understand and learn the basics:
  - Nana and Amigoscode created a 4-hour video covering (Docker and Kubernetes)[https://youtu.be/bhBSlnQcq2k]  
- Ensure you start early in understanding and applying best practices:
  - [Container image build best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)
  
- Get more overview of the CNCF ecosystem
  - [The CNCF Glossary](https://glossary.cncf.io/)
  - Saiyam Pathak [CNCF minutes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5uLNcv9SibB658blGUEv18IhcMGL0dxC)
  - Blog posts

- Understand and learn the history, differences and special use cases especially for CNCF projects
  - For example Docker vs. Containerd vs. CRI-o, and other container runtimes e.g. rkt, gvisor, kata.
  - The different Gitops engines: Flusk, ArgoCD, Fleet
- Don't stop learning and always be curious

### Cloud Native definition
- Cloud Native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and **declarative APIs** exemplify this approach.

- These techniques enable loosely-coupled systems that are **resilient**, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, **vendor-neutral** projects. We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these innovations accessible for everyone.
